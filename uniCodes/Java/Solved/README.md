*****This challange was really good for practing java*****

**Java is a very intuitive programming language and soon after reading [HashMap Oracle Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) i really started creating some plausible code**

*I tested new opensource test kits for programming aids on a.i, using projects such as [](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite) to analyse new ai co-developers, but they still where lacking the sense of optimizing code
and using good code practices and I eventually refectored the code to use hashmaps, and seperated the tripChallange in two parts after the original code was posted using the a.i assitance on for example,
recognizing variable list pattenrs listed bellow on code notes (this was pure ADHD);*

```rust
  code notes:
        1 - trips.add(new Trip(destination:"Paris", preference: "Fast", duration:7, cost:900.00, scales.1)); //this was the new class list method suggested by the a.i;
        2 - addTrip(trips, new Trip("Tokyo", Preference.LESS, 22, 1100.00, 1)); // this is hashmap defined with ' Map<String, Map<Preference, Trip>> ' (Lk10);
        3 - //The value methods where not guessed corretly by the llvm prediction training ([NOTICE]:review);
```
